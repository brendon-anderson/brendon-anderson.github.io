*I am currently looking for undergraduate and graduate students to join my research projects.* Highly motivated students with strengths in mathematics and computer programming are especially encouraged to reach out. Students from outside of Mechanical Engineering are also welcome, as my research is inherently cross-disciplinary. If you are interested in learning more, please email me!

== About

I am interested in the development and analysis of *safe and reliable computational methods* by applying rigorous mathematics to interdisciplinary problems in the areas of *machine learning*, *optimization*, *control theory*, and *game theory*. My latest projects surround provable safety for neural networks using robust optimization theory, stability guarantees for infinite-dimensional evolutionary games using functional analysis, and robust control of distributed systems using optimal transport theory. I encourage you to look at my [/https://brendon-anderson.github.io/publications.html publications] for more details.

*Fun fact:* I have an Erd\&\#337;s number of $3$ (Paul Erd\&\#337;s $\sim$ Fan Chung $\sim$ Andrea L. Bertozzi $\sim$ Brendon G. Anderson).
