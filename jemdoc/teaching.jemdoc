While at UC Berkeley, I've served as a Graduate Student Instructor for the following undergraduate and graduate optimization courses. I have received the [https://gsi.berkeley.edu/programs-services/award-programs/ogsi/ogsi-recipients-2022-2023/ *Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor Award*] in recognition of my teaching.

In the past, I worked as a Supplemental Intructor for Electromagnetism (PHYS 231) and General Chemistry (CHEM 115) at Palomar College. Below are some of the resources I created for these courses.

- [files/teaching/phys_231_practice_exam_2.pdf Practice exam \#2] ([files/teaching/phys_231_practice_exam_2_solution.pdf solution])
- [files/teaching/phys_231_sliding_block.pdf Additional practice problem]

== General Chemistry (CHEM 115) --- Fall 2014, Spring 2015
- [files/teaching/chem_115_practice_exam_2.pdf Practice exam \#2] ([files/teaching/chem_115_practice_exam_2_solutions.pdf solution])
